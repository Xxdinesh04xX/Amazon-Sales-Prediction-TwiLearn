Amazon Sales Analysis

In this project, we analyze the Amazon Sales Dataset to uncover insights into sales trends and influencing factors. Our key objectives include:

Yearly and Monthly Sales Trends: Identifying revenue patterns and peak sales periods.
Sales Influencers: Exploring factors like product categories, pricing, marketing campaigns, and customer reviews.
Predictive Modeling: Building a machine learning model to forecast future sales.
We will leverage Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-Learn for analysis and prediction.
